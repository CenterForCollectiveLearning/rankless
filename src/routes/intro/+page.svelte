<h1>
	In a world where every country wants to become a knowledge powerhouse, we need more than
	university rankings.
</h1>

<h1>
	Universities are a source of cultural and economic growth. They attract talent, educate the
	population, and help produce important innovations
</h1>

<h1>
	But the impact of universities cannot be reduced to a single number. Knowledge is highly specific,
	and so is the impact of universities.
</h1>

<h1>
	Universities specialize in fields and have important local networks of collaboration. Isn't it
	time we understand them in their right context.
</h1>

<h1>
	Consider three similarly “ranked” universities. The Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences
	(SLU), the University of Belgrade, in Serbia, and the University of Lille, in France. SLU is
	contributes knowledge in Ecology, Environmental Science, and Geography and is cited mostly by
	scholars from XXX, YYY, and ZZZ universities.The University of Belgrade, contributes knowledge on
	X, Y, and Z and is cited by X, Y, and Z universities.The University of Lille in France, is best
	known for mathematics, and is cited by X, Y, and Z.
</h1>

<h1>
	Academic impact is not a single thing, but a rich kaleidoscope of topics and geographies that can
	be exciting to explore. Go ahead and explore impact beyond rankings, at the academic impact
	explorer.
